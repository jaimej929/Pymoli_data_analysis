Congratulations! After a lot of hard work in the data munging mines, you've landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. You've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.
Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.




## Description
_______________________________
With some of the code I was able to use it helped manage to see some data that could be gathered on different specific types of trends based of gender and age.



## Age
__________________________________
With the statistic that could be pulled out from the data into a age based demo, we can see the game pulls alot form the 20 to 24 year old range. 
This is a good way to see that appealing to this group is very good in the sense they have an income to be able to spend more money into the game.


## Gender
________________________________
Gender wise we can see the male demo is who is attracted more to the game and more revenue comes in, but that can be skewed a bit since the amount of male players is about 6 times that of other genders.
We do however, see that the other genders while less than the male in terms of players, they do seem to be spending more money per purchase in in-game buys.
